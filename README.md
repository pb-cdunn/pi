# pi
Pacbio Integration -- a consistent contour of submodule commits for all GitHub repos that we use internally

## Purpose
We use this package to pull GitHub modules into Pacbio after `p4 sync`.

## Directions

1. Please keep this package *simple*. We want the history of this package to be mainly about submodule updates.
2. See wiki: https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pi/wiki
